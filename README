Set/get serial interface baud rate on Linux. Unlike stty, baudrate understands
the new Linux API which supports arbitrary rates.

USAGE:

	baudrate <device>
		- prints current baud rate

	baudrate <device> <rate>
		- requests given rate, prints rate assigned by the driver
		  (due to HW constraints, this need not be the requested rate)

Normally prints one line indicating speed in bauds.

Prints two lines, corresponding to input and output speed, if those differ.
Setting different input and output rates is not supported by this tool.

WARNING: some drivers may lie and report the last requested rate even if it
has been internally adjusted to fit hardware limitations.
